# Automatic Masking System for Cartridge Case Analysis in Forensic Investigations

## Description

This project introduces an innovative solution for automating the process of masking and coloring specific features on cartridge case images, a task traditionally performed manually in forensic laboratories. The system is designed to assist in the analysis of fired ammunition components, particularly cartridge cases, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of forensic examinations in ballistic investigations.


### Installation

Install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Folder Structure

Dataset/: Contains raw and processed images of cartridge cases.

my_model/: Contains model files and checkpoints for the masking algorithm.

json_files/: JSON files with annotations for training and testing.

requirements.txt: Required libraries and dependencies for the project.

masking_algorithm.ipynb: The main script for the masking process.

report.pdf: Detailed report of the project and algorithm performance.
